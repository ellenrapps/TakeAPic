                <Bold>What are the known issues? </Bold> <LineBreak/>
                One of the causes of failure to initialize this app is that the computer's camera and microphone <LineBreak/>
                are disabled. Disabling the camera and microphone also disables the “Take a Photo” function of <LineBreak/>
                this app. 
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                While the microphone isn’t essentially needed for this app, the microphone is integrated for the <LineBreak/>
                camera to operate. Please enable the computer's camera and microphone when using this app. <LineBreak/>
                To enable the camera and microphone, go to Windows "Settings", click on the "Privacy" button and <LineBreak/> 
                give "Camera" and "Microphone" app permissions.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                Another known issue is double-clicking the Take a Photo button. Don't double click the<LineBreak/> 
                Take a Photo button. Give the camera one second to prepare to take another photo.
